# Contributing to mcp-twake-space

Thank you for your interest in mcp-twake-space! This project is part of the open source ecosystem of [Twake.ai](https://twake.ai), the sovereign Digital Workplace developed by [LINAGORA](https://linagora.com). Contributions of every kind are welcome: bug reports, documentation, tests, compatibility reports with other servers, and code.

By participating, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug**: open an issue with the *Bug report* template.
- **Suggest a feature or a new tool**: open an issue with the *Feature request* template, and describe the use case before the solution.
- **Report a vulnerability**: never in a public issue; follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Improve the documentation**: typos, examples, MCP client configurations, translations.
- **Send a pull request**: for anything bigger than a small fix, open an issue first so we can agree on the approach.

## Development setup

Requirements: Node.js >= 22 and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linagora/mcp-twake-space.git
cd mcp-twake-space
npm install
npm run build   # compile TypeScript to build/
npm test        # run the test suite (Vitest)
```

Tests never touch a real server: they use mocks and fixtures. Do not add tests that need real credentials.

### Project structure

```
src/
  config.ts          # environment validation
  space.ts           # Twake Space API client, token file, errors with hints
  token-command.ts   # access token from an external broker (TWAKE_SPACE_TOKEN_COMMAND)
  format.ts          # time zones, name matching, AI-friendly views of spaces and feed items
  tools.ts           # MCP tool implementations
  index.ts           # stdio transport, `check` command
scripts/             # live test against a real space (never run in CI)
tests/               # unit tests with a fake Twake Space backend (Vitest)
```

## Coding guidelines

- TypeScript in **strict mode**, ESM modules with `.js` import extensions (required by the MCP SDK).
- **stdout is reserved for the MCP JSON-RPC protocol**: all logs go to stderr through the logger.
- Validate tool inputs with Zod schemas, and give every tool accurate MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`).
- Error messages say what went wrong **and** how to fix it: they are read by an AI assistant and by its user.
- Never log or return secrets (passwords, tokens, refresh tokens). Never commit real hostnames, accounts or personal data in tests or docs: use `example.com`.
- A new tool or environment variable must come with tests and an update of the README.

## Commits and pull requests

- Branch from `main`: `feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`, `refactor/…`, `test/…`, `chore/…`.
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat: add attendee support to create_event`.
- Keep pull requests focused on one concern, describe what changes and why, and link the related issue.
- Before opening the pull request: `npm run build` and `npm test` must pass (CI runs both).
- Add a line to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under *Unreleased* for any user-visible change.
